The vertices of the graph are where the graph connects together or branches out, in this example, graph A's vertex (node) is where the values 2 and 3 meet at the top of the graph at the value 1. The edges are basically the parts that branch out from the vertices or other values such as the branch between 1 and 2 or 2 and 4.\n",
